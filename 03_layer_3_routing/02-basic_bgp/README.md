# Lab Guide: Deploying Basic BGP
> [!NOTE]
> This lab is based on the AOS-CX Switch Simulator Labs. A ```topology.clab.yaml``` file was added to use the lab with [containerlab](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes that the AOS-CX Switch Simulator is available as a docker container. You can use [vrnetlab](https://github.com/hellt/vrnetlab) to accomplish this.

>[!NOTE]
> This description is based on the AOS-CX Switch Simulator Lab Guide [Deploying Basic BGP](https://community.arubanetworks.com/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=b7f3d72a-23ba-48e0-bfad-2b18836fef33) and includes all necessary changes to use the lab with [containerlab](https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab).

## Lab Objective
At the end of this workshop, you will be able to implement the basic configuration to enable both iBGP and EBGP. The main goal
in to ensure Hosts within different Layer 3 autonomous systems (AS) can reach each other.

For stability, a best practice is to peer using loopbacks for iBGP. To achieve this, you will first configure an IGP protocol (OSPF)
to enable loopback reachability for iBGP peering. You will also need to ensure the host networks are advertised into the BGP
fabric. You will then create an EBGP peering relationship into another AS and ensure the hosts can communicate across ASs.

Finally, once the hosts can communicate across the ASs you will add a layer of security by creating a policy which blocks traffic
from a certain host. Once enabled you will see that the hosts cannot communicate, however the switches can still reach the
hosts across the ASs.

## Lab Overview
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability
information among autonomous systems (AS) both on the Internet and even within and across enterprise organizations. BGP is
classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets
configured by a network administrator.

BGP may be used for routing within an autonomous system. In this application it is referred to as Interior Border Gateway
Protocol, Internal BGP, or iBGP. In contrast, when routing between different autonomous systems the protocol may be referred
to as Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP, or eBGP.
The characteristics of BGP are:

- The current version of BGP is BGP version 4, based on RFC4271.
- BGP is the path-vector protocol that provides routing information for autonomous systems on the Internet via its AS-
Path attribute.
- BGP is a Layer 4 protocol that sits on top of TCP. It is much simpler than OSPF, because it doesnâ€™t have to worry about
the things TCP will handle.
- Peers that have been manually configured to exchange routing information will form a TCP connection and begin
speaking BGP. There is no discovery in BGP.
- Medium-sized businesses usually get into BGP for the purpose of true multi-homing for their entire network.
- An important aspect of BGP is that the AS-Path itself is an anti-loop mechanism. Routers will not import any routes that
contain themselves in the AS-Path.

> [!NOTE]
> With the AOS-CX Switch Simulator in the lab, after adding a route-map you will need to clear BGP from user mode to make the map take effect.

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Lab Setup
For this lab refer to [Figure 1](#network-layout) for topology an IP address details.

- Deploy the containerlab topology file: ```sudo containerlab deploy -t topology.clab.yaml``` (or use the [containerlab extension](https://containerlab.dev/manual/vsc-extension/) for Visual Studio Code)
  - All the connections between nodes are already set-up
  - Check that sufficient numbers of CPUs and RAM is available for three AOS-CX nodes (at least 1 vCPU and 2048 MB per node)
  - Ensure that the environment variable ```AOS_CX_VERSION``` is set to a value that matches the image version (default is ```latest```)
    - If ```AOS_CX_VERSION``` is not set, image ```vrnetlab/aruba_arubaos-cx:latest``` will be deployed
    - If ```AOS_CX_VERSION=20241115202521```, image ```vrnetlab/aruba_arubaos-cx:20241115202521``` will be deployed
- Open SSH session to each switch and log in with user 'admin' and password 'admin'.

Note: Switch X will be configured later in the lab. The Virtual PC (VPC-C) is not required to be configured and just shown to
represent an access port.

On all devices, bring up required ports:
```
Switch[A-C]# configure terminal
Switch[A-C](config)#
```
Copy/Paste the configuration to Switch A and Switch B:
```
int 1/1/1-1/1/2
  no shutdown
``` 
Leave configuration mode by pressing ```Ctrl-z```.

Validate LLDP neighbors appear as expected on each switch. Here we show Switch B output only.
```

```

### Task 2: Configure Interfaces and Verify Direct Connectivity

Configure switch interfaces and ensure direct connectivity works:
- Apply proper IPv4 Addresses to all interfaces, including loopback
- On Switch A and C:
  - Create Host facing VLAN/Interface
  - Apply proper VLAN to host facing access interface
- Ensure direct connectivity works between each link

```
### Task 3: Configure OSPF on SwitchB and SwitchC

- Create OSPF process 1 and area 0
- Create an OSPF IPv4 Router-ID (same as Loopback)
- Ensure interfaces are added to OSPF table
- Use OSPF point to point
- Ensure Loopback 0 and switch to switch interfaces on Switch B and C are advertised into OSPF
- Ensure VLAN 7 interface on Switch C is advertised into OSPF
- Verify OSPF peering is up between Switch B and C

#### SwitchB
```
SwitchB# configure terminal
SwitchB(config)#
```
Copy/Paste the configuration to Switch B:
```
router ospf 1

```

### Task 4: Configure IBGP on SwitchB and SwitchC

- To prevent route flapping caused by port state changes, this example uses loopback interfaces to establish IBGP
connections
- Loopback interfaces are virtual interfaces. Therefore, use the update-source loopback command to specify the loopback
interface as the source interface for establishing BGP connections.
- Create a BGP router-ID
- Ensure HostB segment is added to the BGP table
- Add the neighbor default originate command to send a default route to SwitchC
- Verify BGP peering is up between SwitchB and C

#### SwitchB
```
SwitchB# configure terminal
SwitchB(config)#
```
Copy/Paste the configuration to Switch B:
```
router bgp 65000
  bgp router-id 192.168.2.2
  neighbor 192.168.2.3 remote-as 65000
  neighbor 192.168.2.3 update-source loopback 0
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 192.168.2.3 activate
    neighbor 192.168.2.3 default-originate
  exit-address-family
```
Leave configuration mode by pressing ```Ctrl-z```.

#### SwitchC
```

    neighbor 192.168.2.2 activate
    network 10.10.110.0/24

```

```
### Task 5: Configure EBGP
- The EBGP peers, SwitchA and SwitchB are located in different ASs and usually belong to different carriers. Typically, their
loopback interfaces are not reachable to each other, so directly connected interfaces are used for establishing EBGP
sessions.
- Create a BGP router-ID for Switch A
- Verify BGP peering is up between Switch A and B
- Verify that HostA can reach HostB

### Task 7: Finish by Adding a Layer of Security Which Blocks Unwanted Communication
- In this example, create a route-map which blocks HostB from communication into AS65001
- After the route-map has been applied to the IPv4 Address Family, move to user mode and clear the BGP session to its
neighbor 100.1.1.1. This will reset BGP and ensure the route-map is now working
- Once completed, HostA and HostB should not be able to communicate, however, SwitchB will still be able to reach HostA
